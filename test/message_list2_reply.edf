    <text="Or how about just displaying the fact that the message has been edited, like
most bulletin board software does? If it means that much to you, store the
original message and allow people to view the original through some magic key
sequence or something. Annotations are a piss-poor implementation of message
editing, and there's no reason it shouldn't be done properly. If people take
advantage of it and start being dicks, then people will just killfile them or
ignore their messages and not post replies.

What we don't need is some half-arsed new thing which doesn't have a full set
of features, but was created due to one person's view on the world (no
offence, techno). If you're going to do this, at least take into account other
people's wishes, or else this is just going to fragment and die because of it."/>
